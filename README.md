RainLexer adds syntax highlighting support for Rainmeter .ini configuration files to Notepad++. To download RainLexer, follow the [installation instructions](http://poiru.github.com/rainlexer).

To build RainLexer, you will need [WinDDK 7.1](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11800). After you have it installed, make sure that the `WinDDK71Dir` entry in `Config.props` has the correct path.
You can then build RainLexer by opening `RainLexer.sln`. Alternatively, you can run `Build\Build.bat` to build RainLexer and the installer.
